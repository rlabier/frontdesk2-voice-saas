I am researching the pain points of being a single parent - particularly for single men with daughters, with regard to creating joy in the home. I will use the research in  a book called "Joy in the home". Can you summarise the most frequently discussed complaints and requests for advice, of single parents, particularly with regard to creating a loving supporting an nurturing environment at home. I am looking for broad commentaries, but with each topic summarized.

Single fathers raising daughters face unique challenges in fostering a joyful, loving, and nurturing home environment. Below is a summary of the most frequently discussed pain points and requests for advice, based on available research and insights, tailored to the context of creating joy in the home for your book, Joy in the Home. The topics are drawn from general discussions on single parenting, with a focus on single fathers where possible, and are summarized for clarity and relevance.
